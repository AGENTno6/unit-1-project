          <h2> Depression</h2>
          <h3>Depression Causes</h3>
          <p>
            Abuse. Physical, sexual, or emotional abuse can make you more vulnerable to depression later in life.
            Age. People who are elderly are at higher risk of depression. That can be made worse by other factors, such as living alone and having a lack of social support.
            Certain medications. Some drugs can increase your risk of depression.
            Conflict. Depression in someone who has the biological vulnerability to it may result from personal conflicts or disputes with family members or friends.
            Death or a loss. Sadness or grief after the death or loss of a loved one, though natural, can increase the risk of depression.
            Genes. A family history of depression may increase the risk.
            Major events. Even good events such as starting a new job, graduating, or getting married can lead to depression. So can moving, losing a job or income, getting divorced, or retiring. However, the syndrome of clinical depression is never just a "normal" response to stressful life events.
            Other personal problems. Problems such as social isolation due to other mental illnesses or being cast out of a family or social group can contribute to the risk of developing clinical depression.
            Serious illnesses. Sometimes, depression happens along with a major illness or may be triggered by another medical condition.
            Substance misuse. Nearly 30% of people with substance misuse problems also have major or clinical depression. Even if drugs or alcohol temporarily make you feel better, they ultimately will aggravate depression.
          </p>

          <h3>Depression Treatment</h3>

          <p>If you have symptoms of depression, talk to your doctor. They can evaluate you and offer you treatment or refer you to a mental health professional.
            The type of treatment they recommend for you will depend on your symptoms and how severe they are. You may need one or more of the following:

          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Medication. Antidepressant medications (used alone or with psychotherapy) are effective for most people with depression. There are many types of antidepressants. You may have to try several kinds before you find the one that works best for you. You may need a combination of two. Or your doctor may also prescribe another type of medication to help your antidepressant work best, such as a mood stabilizer, antipsychotic, anxiety medication, or stimulant medication. </li>
            <li>Psychotherapy. Talking to a mental health professional on a regular basis about your depression and other issues can help treat your symptoms. Methods include cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), a common form of talk therapy.</li>
            <li>Hospital or residential treatment. If your depression is bad enough that you’re having trouble taking care of yourself, or you may harm yourself or others, you may need psychiatric treatment in a hospital or residential facility.</li>
            <li>Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). In this treatment, electric currents are passed through your brain to help your neurotransmitters work better. Typically, you won’t have this therapy unless antidepressants aren’t working, or you can’t take them for other health reasons.</li>
            <li>Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Your doctor typically suggests this only after antidepressants haven’t worked. This treatment uses a coil to send magnetic pulses through your brain to help stimulate nerve cells that regulate your mood.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Anxiety </h2>
          <p>
            Experiencing occasional anxiety is a normal part of life. However, people with anxiety disorders frequently have intense, excessive and persistent worry and fear about everyday situations. Often, anxiety disorders involve repeated episodes of sudden feelings of intense anxiety and fear or terror that reach a peak within minutes (panic attacks).
            These feelings of anxiety and panic interfere with daily activities, are difficult to control, are out of proportion to the actual danger and can last a long time. You may avoid places or situations to prevent these feelings.</p>

          <h2>CAUSES</h2>

          <p>Anxiety disorders are like other forms of mental illness. They don’t come from personal weakness, character flaws or problems with upbringing. But researchers don’t know exactly what causes anxiety disorders.</p>

          <h3>Physical symptoms:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Cold or sweaty hands.</li>
            <li>Dry mouth.</li>
            <li>Heart palpitations.</li>
            <li>Nausea.</li>
            <li>Numbness or tingling in hands or feet.</li>
            <li>Muscle tension.</li>
            <li>Shortness of breath.
          </ul>

          <h3>Mental symptoms:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Feeling panic, fear and uneasiness.</li>
            <li>Nightmares.</li>
            <li>Repeated thoughts or flashbacks of traumatic experiences.</li>
            <li>Uncontrollable, obsessive thoughts.</li>
          </ul>


          <h3>Behavioral symptoms:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Inability to be still and calm.</li>
            <li>Ritualistic behaviors, such as washing hands repeatedly.</li>
            <li>Trouble sleeping.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>TREATMENT</h3>

          <p>Your healthcare provider will tailor a treatment plan that works for you. Your plan may combine medication and psychotherapy. Medications can’t cure an anxiety disorder. But they can improve symptoms and help you function better.
            Medications for anxiety disorders often include:</p>

          <p>Anti-anxiety medications, may decrease your anxiety, panic and worry. They work quickly, but you can build up a tolerance to them which can make them less effective over time.
            Antidepressants can also help with anxiety disorders. They tweak how your brain uses certain chemicals to improve mood and reduce stress. Antidepressants may take some time to work, so be patient. If you feel like you’re ready to stop taking antidepressants, talk to your provider first.
            Beta-blockers, usually used for high blood pressure, can help reduce some of the physical symptoms of anxiety disorders. They can relieve rapid heartbeat, shaking and trembling.
            Your healthcare provider will work with you to find the right medication combination and dosage.
            Psychotherapy, or counseling, helps you deal with your emotional response to the illness. A mental health provider talks through strategies to help you better understand and manage the disorder. Approaches include:
            Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is the most common type of psychotherapy used with anxiety disorders. CBT for anxiety teaches you to recognize thought patterns and behaviors that lead to troublesome feelings. You then work on changing them.
            Exposure therapy focuses on dealing with the fears behind the anxiety disorder. It helps you engage with activities or situations you may have been avoiding. Your provider may also use relaxation exercises and imagery with exposure therapy.</p>

          <p>How can I best cope with an anxiety disorder?

            There are several steps you can take to cope with anxiety disorder symptoms. These strategies can also make your treatment more effective:

            Explore stress management: Learn ways to manage stress, such as through meditation.
            Join support groups: These groups are available in-person and online. They encourage people with anxiety disorders to share their experiences and coping strategies.
            Get educated: Learn about the specific type of anxiety disorder you have so you feel more in control. Help friends and loved ones understand the disorder as well so they can support you.
            Limit or avoid caffeine: Many people with anxiety disorder find that caffeine can worsen their symptoms.
            Talk to your healthcare provider: Your provider is your partner in your care. If you feel like treatment isn’t working or have questions about your medication, contact your provider. Together, you can figure out how to best move forward.</p>

          <h2>PTSD</h2>
          <p>
            Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a mental health condition that's triggered by a terrifying event — either experiencing it or witnessing it. Symptoms may include flashbacks, nightmares and severe anxiety, as well as uncontrollable thoughts about the event.

            Most people who go through traumatic events may have temporary difficulty adjusting and coping, but with time and good self-care, they usually get better. If the symptoms get worse, last for months or even years, and interfere with your day-to-day functioning, you may have PTSD.

            Getting effective treatment after PTSD symptoms develop can be critical to reduce symptoms and improve function.

          </p>

          <h3>Symptoms</h3>
          <p>Post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms may start within one month of a traumatic event, but sometimes symptoms may not appear until years after the event. These symptoms cause significant problems in social or work situations and in relationships. They can also interfere with your ability to go about your normal daily tasks.

            PTSD symptoms are generally grouped into four types: intrusive memories, avoidance, negative changes in thinking and mood, and changes in physical and emotional reactions. Symptoms can vary over time or vary from person to person</p>
