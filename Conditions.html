          <p>Depression (major depressive disorder) is a common and serious medical illness that negatively affects how you feel, the way you think and how you act. Fortunately, it is also treatable.

          <h2 class="condition-title animate__animated animate__slideInDown">Anxiety </h2>
          <p>
            Experiencing occasional anxiety is a normal part of life. However, people with anxiety disorders frequently have intense, excessive and persistent worry and fear about everyday situations. Often, anxiety disorders involve repeated episodes of sudden feelings of intense anxiety and fear or terror that reach a peak within minutes (panic attacks).
            These feelings of anxiety and panic interfere with daily activities, are difficult to control, are out of proportion to the actual danger and can last a long time. You may avoid places or situations to prevent these feelings.</p>

          <h3 class="subheading">Causes:</h3>

          <p>Anxiety disorders are like other forms of mental illness. They don’t come from personal weakness, character flaws or problems with upbringing. But researchers don’t know exactly what causes anxiety disorders.</p>

          <h3 class="subheading">Physical Symptoms:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Cold or sweaty hands.</li>

            <li>Nausea.</li>
            <li>Numbness or tingling in hands or feet.</li>
            <li>Muscle tension.</li>
            <li>Shortness of breath.
          </ul>

          <h3 class="subheading">Mental Symptoms:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Feeling panic, fear and uneasiness.</li>
            <li>Nightmares.</li>
            <li>Repeated thoughts or flashbacks of traumatic experiences.</li>
            <li>Uncontrollable, obsessive thoughts.</li>
          </ul>


          <h3 class="subheading">Behavioral Symptoms:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Inability to be still and calm.</li>
            <li>Ritualistic behaviors, such as washing hands repeatedly.</li>
            <li>Trouble sleeping.</li>

          <span id="period">...</span><span id="mas">

          <p>Your healthcare provider will tailor a treatment plan that works for you. Your plan may combine medication and psychotherapy. Medications can’t cure an anxiety disorder. But they can improve symptoms and help you function better.
            Medications for anxiety disorders often include:</p>


          <ul>
              <li>Anti-anxiety medications may decrease your anxiety, panic and worry.</li>
              <li>They work quickly, but you can build up a tolerance to them which can make them less effective over time.</li>
              <li>Antidepressants can also help with anxiety disorders. </li>
              <li>They tweak how your brain uses certain chemicals to improve mood and reduce stress.</li> 
              <li>Antidepressants may take some time to work, so be patient. </li>
              <li>If you feel like you’re ready to stop taking antidepressants, talk to your provider first.</li>
              <li>Beta-blockers, usually used for high blood pressure, can help reduce some of the physical symptoms of anxiety disorders. </li>
              <li>They can relieve rapid heartbeat, shaking and trembling.</li>
              <li>Your healthcare provider will work with you to find the right medication combination and dosage.</li>
              <li>Psychotherapy, or counseling, helps you deal with your emotional response to the illness.</li>
              <li>A mental health provider talks through strategies to help you better understand and manage the disorder.</li> 
             </ul> 
            
            <p>Approaches include:
            Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is the most common type of psychotherapy used with anxiety disorders. CBT for anxiety teaches you to recognize thought patterns and behaviors that lead to troublesome feeling. You then work on changing them. 
            Exposure therapy focuses on dealing with the fears behind the anxiety disorder. It helps you engage with activities or situations you may have been avoiding. Your provider may also use relaxation exercises and imagery with exposure therapy.</p>

            <h3 class="subheading">How can I best cope with an anxiety disorder?</h3>

            <p>There are several steps you can take to cope with anxiety disorder symptoms. </p>
            <p>These strategies can also make your treatment more effective:</p>


            <ul>
              <li>Explore stress management:
                <ul><li>Learn ways to manage stress, such as through meditation.</li></ul>
              </li>

          <h2 class="condition-title animate__animated animate__slideInDown">PTSD</h2>
          <p>
            Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a mental health condition that's triggered by a terrifying event — either experiencing it or witnessing it. Symptoms may include flashbacks, nightmares and severe anxiety, as well as uncontrollable thoughts about the event.

            Most people who go through traumatic events may have temporary difficulty adjusting and coping, but with time and good self-care, they usually get better. If the symptoms get worse, last for months or even years, and interfere with your day-to-day functioning, you may have PTSD.

            Getting effective treatment after PTSD symptoms develop can be critical to reduce symptoms and improve function.

          </p>

          <h3 class="subheading">Symptoms:</h3>
          <p>Post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms may start within one month of a traumatic event, but sometimes symptoms may not appear until years after the event. These symptoms can cause significant problems in social or work situations and in relationships. They can also interfere with your ability to go about your normal daily tasks.

            PTSD symptoms are generally grouped into four types: intrusive memories, avoidance, negative changes in thinking and mood, and changes in physical and emotional reactions. Symptoms can vary over time or vary from person to person.</p>

          <h3 class="subheading">Treatment:</h3>
          <p>Post-traumatic stress disorder treatment can help you regain a sense of control over your life. The primary treatment is psychotherapy, but can also include medication. Combining these treatments can help improve your symptoms by:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Teaching you skills to address your symptoms</li>
            <li>Helping you think better about yourself, others and the world</li>
            <li>Learning ways to cope if any symptoms arise again</li>
            <li>Treating other problems often related to traumatic experiences, such as depression, anxiety, or misuse of alcohol or drugs</li>
            <li>You don't have to try to handle the burden of PTSD on your own.</li>
          </ul>


          <h3 class="subheading">Psychotherapy:</h3>
          
          <span id="dots2">...</span><span id="more2">
          
          <p>Several types of psychotherapy, also called talk therapy, may be used to treat children and adults with PTSD. Some types of psychotherapy used in PTSD treatment include:</p>
          <ul>

            <li>Cognitive therapy. </li>
            <li>This type of talk therapy helps you recognize the ways of thinking (cognitive patterns) that are keeping you stuck.</li>
            <li>For example, negative beliefs about yourself and the risk of traumatic things happening again.</li>
            <li>For PTSD, cognitive therapy often is used along with exposure therapy.</li>



          </ul>

          <h3 class="subheading">Exposure Therapy:</h3>
          <ul>


            <li>This behavioral therapy helps you safely face both situations and memories that you find frightening so that you can learn to cope with them effectively.</li>
            <li>Exposure therapy can be particularly helpful for flashbacks and nightmares.
            <li>One approach uses virtual reality programs that allow you to re-enter the setting in which you experienced trauma.</li>
            <li>Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR).</li>
            <li>EMDR combines exposure therapy with a series of guided eye movements that help you process traumatic memories and change how you react to them.</li>
            <li>Your therapist can help you develop stress management skills to help you better handle stressful situations and cope with stress in your life.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            All these approaches can help you gain control of lasting fear after a traumatic event. You and your mental health professional can discuss what type of therapy or combination of therapies may best meet your needs.
            You may try individual therapy, group therapy or both. Group therapy can offer a way to connect with others going through similar experiences.
          </p>
          
          <h3 class="subheading">When someone you love has PTSD:</h3>

          <p>The person you love may seem like a different person than you knew before the trauma — angry and irritable, for example, or withdrawn and depressed. PTSD can significantly strain the emotional and mental health of loved ones and friends.

            Hearing about the trauma that led to your loved one's PTSD may be painful for you and even cause you to relive difficult events. You may find yourself avoiding his or her attempts to talk about the trauma or feeling hopeless that your loved one will get better. At the same time, you may feel guilty that you can't fix your loved one or hurry up the process of healing.</p>


          <h3 class="subheading">Remember that you can't change someone. However, you can:</h3>

          <ul>
            <li>Learn about PTSD.
              <ul>
                <li>This can help you understand what your loved one is going through.</li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
                <li>Recognize that avoidance and withdrawal are part of the disorder. </li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
                <li>If your loved one resists your help, allow space and let your loved one know that you're available when he or she is ready to accept your help.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>

            <li>Offer to attend medical appointments.
              <ul>
                <li>If your loved one is willing, attending appointments can help you understand and assist with treatment.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>

            <li>Be willing to listen.
              <ul>
                <li>Let your loved one know you're willing to listen, but you understand if he or she doesn't want to talk.</li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
                <li>Try not to force your loved one to talk about the trauma until he or she is ready.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>


            <li>Encourage participation.
              <ul>
                <li>Plan opportunities for activities with family and friends.</li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
                <li>Celebrate good events.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
