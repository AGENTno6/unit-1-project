        <h3>Getting Started, Approaching the Issue</h3>
        <p>
          One of the hardest and most important steps may be just starting the conversation. You do not have to be an expert or to have the answers. Express your concern and willingness to listen and be there for the person. Don't be afraid to talk about it. Reassure them that you care about them and are there for them. Use "I" statements. For example, use "I am worried about you…," "I would like you to consider talking with a counselor…." rather than "You are…." or "You should…."
          Try to show patience and caring and try not to be judgmental of their thoughts and actions. Listen; don't disregard or challenge the person's feelings.
          Encourage them to talk with a mental health care provider or with their primary care provider if that would be more comfortable for them. For some people, it may be helpful to compare the situation to a physical health concerns and how they would respond. For example, if there was a concern about diabetes or high blood pressure would they be likely to seek medical care?
          Remind them that seeking help is a sign of strength.

        <h3>Seek Support for Yourself</h3>
        <p>
          While you're focusing on helping your loved one, it's also important to take care of yourself – physically and emotionally. Reach out for help for yourself if you need it. Recognize and acknowledge the limits of what you can give.
          Blogger Victoria Maxwell writes: "When my mother was ill with the swings of severe depression, mania, and anxiety, I was worried as well as angry. I needed someone outside the family to freely discuss my frustrations and hurt without the fear of upsetting her. A qualified therapist offers clarity, objectivity, solutions not previously seen and a place to safely deal with the emotions rising from such difficult circumstances."
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12">
        <h3>Expectations and Collaboration</h3>
        <p>
          It is important to have realistic expectations. Recovery is generally not a straight-forward process, there will likely be improvements and setbacks along the way. With permission of your family member you can work with their treatment team to help provide support.
          Even if you feel your support and actions are not making a difference, they are likely making a difference for your friend or family member. Your loved one may be hurting and not clearly recognize what you're doing or may not be able to express appreciation. But knowing you are there for them can be important in helping their recovery.
          If you feel your loved one is at risk of hurting themselves or others, contact the National Suicide Prevention Line 800-273-TALK (8255).

        <h3>A Holistic Approach 2 Mental Health</h3>
        <p>
          A holistic approach to mental health puts the patient, not their diagnosis or their symptoms, at the center of their treatment plan. By addressing their emotional, mental, physical, and spiritual needs, a holistic approach to mental health looks at the whole person.
          Holistic mental health treatment does not mean medication is avoided. In fact, a medicinal approach is often used in holistic care and is complemented by therapeutic activities such as talk therapy, group therapy, mindfulness, and art therapy.
          These holistic treatments can help the brain function at a more optimal level so patients can address and improve deeper emotional, mental, and spiritual issues.

      <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12">
        <h3>Benefits of a holistic approach to mental health</h3>
        <p>
          Holistic activities, like talk therapy, group therapy, art therapy, and mindfulness, help improve the overall well-being instead of just physical symptoms.
          "When we treat our bodies as a whole, we are able to see more complete progress," says Asbury.
          Research has found that holistic approaches can improve health outcomes by relieving psychological distress and pain and improving medication adherence and family relationships.
          Holistic activities can lead to improvements in physical health, mental health, emotional health, social health and spiritual health. Medications can help the brain function at an appropriate and functional level so people can dig deeper into what may be going on. Combined, these treatments address the whole person, everything within and outside of the body.
          "We use the medication to help treat symptoms caused by brain functions. However, the more organic aspects of holistic health, such as talk therapy, yoga, and mindfulness, help the physical and mental aspects of mental health treatment," Asbury says.
