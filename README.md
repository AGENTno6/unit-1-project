# Unit 1 Project: HTML/CSS Foundations
## Community Outreach and Consulting

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to:
1. Assess your mastery of the HTML and CSS foundations covered in Unit 1
2. Push you to reach for advanced HTML/CSS solutions to address the needs of your "client".
3. Provide you with real-world experience with the people-facing responsibilities of software engineering, including user research, client consultation, and team collaboration. 
4. Give back to a deserving local business or community member by providing them with free web consultation services.

### Groups
This project will be completed in groups of 2-3. Groups will add an additional set of complexities to this task, as developing software collaboratively requires coordinating schedules for meetings, negotiating product vision, developing and being disciplined about your Git workflow, among many other things. This, in fact, is the point. These are all thing that you will encounter on the job so we may as well begin preparing now! ðŸ˜Š

### Process
1. Identify a small business in your community that you want to support.
2. Make contact with this business to assess interest.
3. Once confirmed, have initial "client meeting" to identify your client's needs, brand, users, etc.
4. Create a wireframe or mockup for your "client" based on their input and your creative direction.
5. (Bonus) Schedule a check-in call or meeting with your client to gather their feedback on your mockup.
6. Incorporate any feedback from your client into your mockup and then build out the site using HTML/CSS.
7. When the site is complete, share with your client and ask for their final feedback. You will no longer be able to incorporate any changes to the site but their feedback will help you to develop as a designer and communicator. If they like your site enough, offer to help them buy a domain and host the site! ðŸ˜ƒ
8. Lastly, we would love to have them join us for final presentation day on Friday, October 11! ðŸŽ‰

As you connect with your clients, **it will be important for you to communicate the following key points:**
* This is primarily a learning experience for _you_, the Fellow. While there is a chance that they come out with a website that they can use to help drive traffic to their business, you should manage their expectations.
* This is free of charge for clients. Instead, we are asking for their time, in the form of two 20-40 minute consultation meetings and permission to showcase this project in your portfolio.
* We will build this site purely in HTML/CSS. Your clients may have certain feature requests that you simply may not be able to implement at this time (e.g. shopping cart, scheduler, log-in/user accounts). You should be upfront about this. That said, I encourage you to seek out existing products that allow you to _embed_ a form or button on your website (e.g. Mailchimp for email contact, StyleSeat for booking appointments, Calendly for scheduling meetings, etc.)

### Tips
* Start early. No matter when you begin, you will not feel like you will have enough time!
* Push yourself. This is the time to experiment with the more advanced techniques that you've been curious about. Don't be afraid to stretch yourself!
* That said, less is more. Pushing yourself should not come at the expense of your client. Take pride in being a _designer_ for this project.
* For those less comfortable in your design skills, check out the resources below.
